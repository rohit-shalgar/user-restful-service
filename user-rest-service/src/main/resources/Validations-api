                        SPRING BOOT STARTER VALIDATION


- validation api is a part of spring boot starter.
- it has validations such as minimum characters, not null, regular expressions
  dates should be in the past or in the future.
- common example of validation API is hibernate validator.
- also, @Valid annotation can be used along with @RequestBody annotation - this will fail the request
if the conditions are not met, its default implementation is provided by spring boot starter.
- we can revert back with a default message when the validation fails.
