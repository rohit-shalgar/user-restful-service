The exception handling we do, should be consistent across all our rest API's.

we define a bean - CommonException
We extend ResponseEntityExceptionHandler and create a CommonExceptionHandler
    - this ResponseEntityExceptionHandler is by default provided by spring boot and is an abstarct class
CommonExceptionHandler will be annoted by @RestControllerAdvice
    RestControllerAdvice -
        . similiar to controller advice with response body
        . class annoted with this annotation indicates, this class has @exceptionHandler methods
        . this methods and by default provided to all the rest controllers, for default custom exception handling
         rather than spring boots ResponseEntityException handler.
CommonExceptionHandler will have @ExceptionHandler methods, handiling all kinds of excepetions based on the customized exception bean
-Exception response.
- also we can override methods from ResponseEntityExceptionHandler and customize it for our needs.
