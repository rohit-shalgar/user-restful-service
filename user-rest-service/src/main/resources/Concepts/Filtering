Filtering:
      . removing some fields from the response. ex - password,  sensitive data
  Static FIltering:
        .@JSONIgnoreProperties() - at the class level, it hard codes the fields so
                                   if their names change we have to make a change.
                                   not recommended.
        .@JsonIgnore - field level to ignore the field from the response.
  Dynamic filtering :
        .MappingJacksonValue.setfilters() - provide the filters.
        .@JsonFilter() - on the class

  Dynamic is useful for APIS to have different behaviour.
