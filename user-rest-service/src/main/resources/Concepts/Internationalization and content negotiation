Spring boot provides MessageSource context, in which you can add
    - messages.properties or messages_{locale}.properties
    - spring boot can read from these files and return the corrosponding response back
    - Locale along with accept -language can be used to achieve this.


content negotiation-
    - consumer can send a header - "accept" and pass Json,XML to accept the response
        in a particular manner.
    - need to add faster jackson xml dependency to return xml content and thats all.
