                                 HATEOS - HYPER LINK AS APPLICATION STATE

if you want to return links to other APIS' or all the APIS, we can make use of HATEOS.
ENtityModel and WebMvcLinkBuilder can be used toghether to build a link and send it back in the response.

this helps us avoid the hardcoding of urls.
